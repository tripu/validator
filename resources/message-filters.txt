# Use this file to filter out (drop/ignore/suppress) errors and warnings you
# don’t care about/don’t want to see/don’t consider to be a problem.
#
# For any error message or warning you want to filter out, add to this file a
# line containing a regular expression that matches the message. Examples:
#
#    .*Text run is not in Unicode Normalization Form C\..*
#    .*appears to be written in.*
#
# The checker automatically reads this file at startup; that is, each time you
# use "./build/build.py run" to (re)start the checker service.
#
# The filters in this file are applied globally to all requests the checker
# receives, from all users of the checker service.
#
# Lines that start with "#" (like this and the above) are ignored.
